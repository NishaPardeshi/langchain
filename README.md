# LangChain Experiments

This repository contains experiments and prototypes exploring various functionalities of **LangChain**, including building LLM-powered pipelines, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows, and integrations with vector stores and external tools.

The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with LangChain components and understand best practices for designing modular, scalable LLM applications.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- LangChain
- OpenAI / LLM APIs
- Chroma / Vector Stores

## What This Repo Explores
- LangChain chains and agents
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Document loaders and chunking strategies
- Vector store integration and querying
- Prompt design and experimentation
